# QIR -- Unsupervised learning approach to quick incident response

### 1. Methods to improve weblogs analysis employing machine learning techniques

**This repository is composed of multiple [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/try) that pass through experiments on the considered weblogs, code snippets, datasets, and various useful resources:***

If you encounter difficulties in viewing the .ipynb files, like shown below, just reload until you get the content.

This behavior is a known issue on Github, as you can see here: https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/3035

Alternatively, you can try the workaround presented at: 

["Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?" when viewing *.ipynb #11](https://github.com/iurisegtovich/PyTherm-applied-thermodynamics/issues/11)

By accessing [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) and pasting the desired notebook link, you can inspect the work quickly and effortlessly. 

Here are the nbviewer links associated with the notebooks as mentioned above:
