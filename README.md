# QIR -- Unsupervised learning approach to quick incident response

### 1. Methods to improve weblogs analysis employing machine learning techniques

**This repository is composed of multiple [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/try) that pass through experiments on the considered weblogs, code snippets, datasets, and various useful resources:***

If you encounter difficulties in viewing the .ipynb files, like shown below, just reload until you get the content.

After the fix, you should see something similar to:

![Fixed](https://github.com/ctinnil/QIR/blob/master/imgs/Screenshot%202021-03-29%20at%2014.17.29.png)

This behavior is a known issue on Github, as you can see here: https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/3035

Alternatively, you can try the workaround presented at:
